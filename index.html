            <p> I was brought on to maintain their Sharepoint platform which was required for their ISO:9001 certification. In order to further my experience I was given access to repositories and asked to assist in developing their other products.  I became part of a team of three who dealt with all IT issues throughout the business and in order to help them succeed engaged in a variety of IT specification roles. We operated a ticket system for development and would also deal with user problems in a 1on1 basis. We applied our own testing and controlled our own repositories meaning that a work day could be quite volatile ranging from developing for live software to resetting passwords.</p>

            <p> I took this role because it developed the skills I had started to practise in Haven in an environment which encouraged my computing skills. This was taken on as cover role to fulfil the role of Business Analyst for a short duration. Although there was not much time to development I recieved a great amount of work and performed the role with uttmost politeness and professionalism. This role was taken on as a contract to expand my exposure and test my skills, i was here to assist with sickness and as such was not around for as long as I would have liked but my time here was a tremendous asset.</p>

          <h3 id="university">University of Northampton, The (2008 - 2012)</h3>
          <p>BA (hons) Philosophy &amp; Education Studies (2:1 second upper)</p>
          <p> I took a three year course with a year of placement studying education studies and philosophy in Northampton. My dissertation piece was a study into the justification for education in prisons. I also developed a passion for the principles of logic, a great respect for Montessori schools and the ability to focus for large periods on a single project</p>

          <h3>Suffolk College (2005 - 2008)</h3>
          <p>Btech Popular Music - DDM (Destintion-Destion-Merit)</p>
          <p>I Progressed to university via music and developed this into a study of Philosophy after finding that the practical applications of mathematics are performed in music. This was to branch out my understandings and ultimately led me back to logic at university where Philosophy defines the principles which underline computing.</p>

          <h3 id="westbourne">Westbourne Highschool &amp; Sixth Form (1998 - 2005)</h3>
          <p>A2 Level (1 E Maths)</p>
          <p>AS Level (1 E Physics)</p>
          <p>GCSE (1 A Maths; 3 Bs Science x2 &amp; Business Studies; 5 Cs English Lit, English, DT, Geography &amp; Religious Education; 1 G German)</p>
          <p>At A-Level I discovered my passion for the guitar and this unfortunately drew my attention more than my pre-planned route to university of mathematics. I maintained the duration of the course, however lost my passion for academic practise in my teenage years. This passion has returned in years since and I am very interested in subjects such as Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, Playing and teaching guitar, statistics, mechanics and foreign languages as an adult. I have been practising Spanish for the last 3 years and have started to branch out into German, French, Japenese and Turkish as <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" title="DuoLingo">duolingo.com</a> allows.</p>

          <h2 id="history">Personal Statement.</h2>
          <p>From a young age I have been around computers, I started on an amiga, using a software my father had designed by combining keyboard strokes with images and a computerised speech back before Personal computers were a common household feature.<p>
          <p>When Microsoft took off, I was privvy to my own personal computer which at the time was predominantly spent on games such as Warcraft, Warcraft II, Starcraft, Doom, Rot, Unreal Tournament and Transport Tycoon. Then came the internet and I found more time for digitial communication software such as MSN. I was <a href="#westbourne" title="Westbourne">studying</a> A-level Maths and Physics and learning how to play the guitar at this time which developed into studying Philosophy and Education at <a href="#university" title="University">Northampton University.</a> I recieved an upper class second (2:1) with honours for my work there, and it was here that I developed my understanding of logic principles which underlie computing systems. As such I began to <a href="#interests" title="Interets">learn</a> the Python language for computers, using source books I was able to develop a number of games on Python from Hangman to more complicated programmes which &lsquo;hide treasure&rsquo; in an ASCII depiction of an ocean (the aim is to locate and collect the treasure using &lsquo;radars&rsquo; which provide an absolute integer as distance between Cartesian grid points).</p>
          <p>Whilst undertaking my university course I maintained a zero-contract role at the local hospital in the domestic department which led to an administrative position in the finance department. I took on a large number of responsibilities in that role which led to developing my professional experience in a finance setting. This is where I started using SQL professionally for data interogation.</p>
          <p>I most recently had a position as a Software developer for a small IT team at <a href="https://www.basetek.co.uk" title="Basetek Homepage">Basetek.</a> Here, I became part of a team of three who dealt with all IT issues throughout the business and in order to help them succeed engaged in a variety of IT <a href="#basetek" title="Internal Basetek">roles.</a> We operated a ticket system for development and would also deal with user problems in a one-on-one basis. We applied our own testing and controlled our own repositories meaning that a work day could be quite volatile ranging from developing for live software to resetting passwords. In a typical day we primarily used Visual Basic and MySQL to produce MVC.Net scripts there would be for procurement applications, websites and software. As such I am very comfortable using C#, HTML, XML, ASP, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, JSON and Xamarin interfaces. I have been assured that my achievements are that of a compentant junior software developer which is what I aim to progress in.</p>
          <p>In order to progress, I have been using the resources at <a href="https://www.lynda.com" title="Lynda Homepage">lynda.com</a> and have so far taken courses in HTML, CSS, Unix, C#, Sharepoint, AMP Servers, Node.js and SQL Server.</p>

          <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
          <p>I have been a guitar player for the past 16 years and like to combine acoustic sounds with musical technology. Initially studying music at college I broke into philosophy and computing through songwriting and sound synthesis / gating. I have been a teacher of music which has improved my communicative ability with my passions, I am also currently in a band who play soulful folk rock with an aim to perform. I have a great passion for technology and have deep interest in the maker movement which is occurring through the progress of open source development in instances such as 3D printers which can be designed and constructed in the confines of your own home. I also greatly enjoy attending RaspberryPi Jams and finding out the brilliant uses of modern technology</p>
